## Model to predict Cancer from Gene Alteration and Text Analysis
### Genomic Alterations were analysed which lead to cancers. A model is developed to predict cancer based on genes.
### Text from Cancer Experts is analysed using Natural Language Processing (Doc2Vec and Artificial Neural Networks) to further help prediction
